<p>My name is Kim Gyung Tae (Korean:김경태 金庚泰 , Nick:bees ). I am a software engineer. I graduated from high school in 1989. I was admitted to the Department of Economics to make money. But the Department of Economics was not a place to make money. I was worried about the future. I quit my university. I went to the army while learning aeronautical technology in Seoul. Since 1994, I spent two years studying computer programming on my own. </p> 
<p>I have experienced a lot of programming since 1999.</p>
