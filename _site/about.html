<p>My name is Zhihao Li (Chinese: 李志浩, Pronunciation: <a href="http://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/zhihao">G-How Lee</a>). I am a software engineer at <a href="http://www.magicleap.com">Magic Leap</a>, working on all kinds of cool stuff on AR/Deep Learning/HCI. I graduated from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a> with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science. The program is one of the most competitive programs (&lt;5% admission rate!). Before that, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from <a href="http://www.tongji.edu.cn/">Tongji University</a>, China.</p>

<p>I am a passionate machine learning and computer vision practitioner and researcher. I also studied neuroscience and cognitive science in college. But I believe computers have their own mechanisms to achieve intelligence, not necessarily the same as humans’.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as a software engineer, I do all kinds of programming/coding, from web front-end, iOS Apps to database and robot platforms. For more, please see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizhihao">Linkedin Profile</a>.</p>
